## The Project

Develop a suite of functions (i.e. a package) that will help professors in their class-management tasks (e.g. computing grades, visualizing class performance, ...).


## Guidelines

- The **activities** below will make you produce new code or alter already exisiting code. Commit every step in the process using thoughtful commit messages.

- If you come up with ideas to improve the code, commit these changes too.

- Push your local repo to Github after each activity.


## Activity 1 (learning goals: local repository, remote repository, commit, push, diff)

- Create a function which assigns a letter grade based on a numeric grade (`assign_letter_grade()`).

	- the first version of the function should use `if()`
	
	- the second version of the function should use `cut()`
	
	- the final version of the function should use `dplyr::case_when()`

- Push your local repository to Github.

- Visualize the **diffs** between your commits.


## Activity 2 (same learning goals as activity 1)

- Create a function to impute `NA` values.

	- The first version of the function should be on a single vector such that it has to be used with several `mutate()` functions.
	
	- The second version of the function should used a scoped version of `mutate()` (i.e. `mutate_*()`).


## Activity 3 (learning goals: pull request, branch, merge)

- Create a function which computes weight averages (`compute_weighted_average()`).

	- The first version of the function should use a pure base `R` approach (with (a1+a2+a3)/3).
	
	- A collaborator on the project  must send a **pull request** and improve the code by using the `mean()` function instead.
	
	- The second version of the function should use the `tidyverse` approach.
	
	
## Activity 4 ()

- Create a function to drop the lowest score in a group of evaluations (`drop_lowest()`).

	- Version 1: 
	
	- Version 2:
